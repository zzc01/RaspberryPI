* Followed intructions from VoidRealms [1].

## Notes
#### [Qt_QhttpDownloadFilesFromWeb](/Qt_QhttpDownloadFilesFromWeb)
* A project to build a surveillance camera for my home. 
* Features: 
  * When detect moving objects the camera starts to record for a period of time and then stop. <br/>
  * The algorithm for moving object detection is based on image subtraction [3]. <br/>
  * Checks hardward free space before recording to avoid running out of space. <br/>


* Me walking in front of the house to test the motion detection camera
